<h1>Hello there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>I'm Matheus Monteiro, I live in Joinville - Santa Catarina, Brazil.</p>

<p>I graduated in gastronomy in 2021 and while I'm studying full-time and still didn't get a job as a developer I'm a home baker and produce some kinds of bread to sell, mostly sourdough ðŸ¥–.</p>

<p>I joined the software development world early this year (2022) when I started studying at <a href="https://www.betrybe.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Trybe</a>. After six months, I feel capable of doing things I've couldn't even imagine I would be doing someday. Since I started my studies in software development, I don't feel dislocated anymore and when people ask me why did I leave the area I was already working before, that's in the top reasons why.</p>

<p>Really hoping to find a job in software development where I can keep evolving everyday and it'll be amazing when I find a place where I can apply some of the things that I've learn in college and also in my previous professional experiences.</p>
